 # Foodpanda Data Analysis Notebook (EDA)
 This notebook explores a dataset of 6,000 customer food orders from Foodpanda. The aim is to understand customer activity—including spending patterns, order history, food choices, payment methods, and feedback—and use those insights to answer key business questions, such as:
 1. Which group people are the most customers?
 2. Which dishes and restaurants are most popular?
 3. What impacts delivery performance and customer churn?
 4. Which city have high number or customer with customer rating?
# What does the data include?
The dataset records details for each order:
1. Who ordered (customer ID, gender, age, city)
2. When they signed up and ordered
3. Restaurant and dish names, and food category
4. Quantity, price, payment method
5. Loyalty points and whether the customer is ‘Active’ or ‘Inactive’
6. Ratings for orders, when they were given, and delivery outcome
